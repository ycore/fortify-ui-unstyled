## Introduction

Fortify-Ui-unstyled provides a UI views scaffolding package with no styling and minimal markup. This can either be installed as an un-styled starter into an existing Laravel project using the [**FortifyUi**][link-fortify-ui] installer or forked to create your own package for styling and scaffolding.

See the [**FortifyUi** readme][link-fortify-ui] for installation instructions.

See the _[**FortifyUi** notes section](https://github.com/ycore/fortify-ui#creating-the-fortify-ui-unstyled-views)_ for details on how the un-styled views were made.

See the _[**FortifyUi** custom UI section](https://github.com/ycore/fortify-ui#installing-your-own-or-community-provided-ui-scaffolding)_ for details on creating and installing custom authentication UI views.

See the _[**FortifyUi** alternate repositories section](https://github.com/ycore/fortify-ui#creating-the-fortify-ui-unstyled-views)_ for details on installing a custom package from alternative repositories.
